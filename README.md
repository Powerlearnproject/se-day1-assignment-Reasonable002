Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaing software.
Importance 
Efficiency: it helps to optimize developer workflow while manintaing high quality standards.
Flexibility: It ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
Reliability: it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare, finance.
Security: Implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering process
Mastering machine
Mastering complexity

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
Requirement analysis: identify the final user specification
Design: building the framework
Coding: converting software design into tangible code
Testing: examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology: Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
- there is low flexibility
- changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.


Agile methodology: Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints)
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements.
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- reporting to the project manager abouit the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (Vscode)
Importance
- an IDE can make suggestins to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
- Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior.
- IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams managge changes to source code over time. eg Git
Importance:
- Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.
- Changing tracking: records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
  solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
  - Software security - programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
    solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third party threats.
    

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit test - are close to the source of an application, they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
- Integration tests: verify that different modulesd or services used by your application work well together
- System testing: Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all funtionalities and interactions.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:
Increased Flexibility: A promnpt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
Improved user experience: Prompt engineernig makes it easy for users to obtain releveant results in the first prompt. it helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the larege language models' training data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeancs, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
- Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full body portrait) rather than just a person.
- Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
- Concise: The additonal details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
